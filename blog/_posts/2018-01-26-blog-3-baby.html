<h3>Baby Melania Walsh is here</h3>
<p>
    Here is my non-software engineering blog post. I was all set to go back to
    work on Monday the 22nd on Sunday night. My wife and I were together in the
    evening watching movies together. I always assumed that when a water breaks
    it would just all come out all at once. Instead, my wife's water had been 
    leaking slowly over the past few days. Today was just enough to be 
    concerned about. We called the doctor and she told us to come in as fast as
    we can.
</p>
<p>
    So, I am panicking and call my parents and say we need to go to the hospital
    and my mom instantly picked up that I was nervous. My brain was moving 100
    miles an hour and within 20 minutes we were packed and ready to go. Our new
    dog Teddy was feeling the energy in the room and let go right near the door
    as we were putting on our coats. I just leashed him and had my wife take him
    out. I quickly through some baking soda on it because I had no time to deal
    with that right now. It later caked over and was hard as a rock by Wednesday
    afternoon.
</p>
<p>
    Everything was calm on the ride over. We get in, the nurses register us and
    we get a room in the labor/delivery ward. My wife's first language is not
    English, and we almost had a situation where because I was trying to explain
    to my wife in as plain English as possible the questions they were asking
    the staff were ready to get the police involved and physically remove me from
    the hospital. The nurses and doctor thought maybe I was too controlling and
    forcing my wife into this situation. Whatever, I don't want to miss my child's
    birth just because the all women staff hate men or something (joking they
    were all sweet once everything was settled).
</p>
<p>
    My wife, god bless her soul, did exactly what she set out to do. This is a
    person who won't take a Tylenol to ease minor pains. She had to be induced
    because we couldn't pin point whether her water just ruptured or happened
    a few days prior so there was nothing she could say about that. But she did
    the rest of the labor painless and all natural. And after she was stitched
    up she walked herself to the six floor to maternity. Absolute trooper.
</p>
<p>
    I couldn't be more happier and more prouder of my wife. I was able to
    cut the cord, and I held her hand the whole time. I just sat there and
    shut upped and watched. I don't think I had the words at the time to speak
    and distract from what happened. Everything moved so fast and now I am a 
    new dad. There was no doubt in my wife's and mine mind that she wasn't a
    Jenna, and the only name that made sense was Melania.
</p>
<p>
    The hospital was great enough to allow me to stay in a bed near my
    wife and child for the next two days. It has been rough since then as my
    little Melania is a night owl. We had a couple tough nights and Anastasia
    is getting use to breast-feeding. We are handling it together and that is 
    the most important thing. I am so happy for my new family and cannot wait
    for all the good years to look forward to.
