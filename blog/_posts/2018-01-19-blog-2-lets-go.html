<h4>Appeals Database</h4>
<p>
    After watching the Golang Object Relational Mapping (GORM) course on 
    <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/gorm-go-object-relational-mapper">
    PluralSight</a>, I started to work on an appeal import process. The course is from
    2015 and doesn't have much of the new features GORM has now. One thing that scared me
    was the instructor talked about how MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite were the only
    databases GORM supported. I quickly visited the GitHub <a href="https://github.com/jinzhu/gorm">repo</a>. GORM uses this concept
    called Dialects that are basically an interface for whatever database driver that GORM
    uses to do its relational mapping. Luckily for me, 2012 SQL Server and beyond is now
    supported in GORM. This was a huge make or break for using this tool for my project.
</p>
<p>
    GORM basically takes the carefully constructed Golang structs I create and creates a
    relation model that is comparable inside the database of my choice. Everything has
    the same syntax since that is taken care of in the dialects for each relational 
    database management systems, or RDBMS for short. After the schema is built it should
    be very simple to perform queries against my new database using the GORM API. GORM
    supports its own syntax and also raw SQL statements in case I have a query that would
    perform better with my SQL.
</p>
<p>
    First step I took with the database was to take the existing tables used in the
    appeals database and convert it to something GORM would understand. As I was
    putting everything into one struct I noticed that this wasn't pretty to look at.
    I wanted to take the unruly single table I was using for all of the appeals and
    transform it into a 
    <a href="https://www.essentialsql.com/get-ready-to-learn-sql-11-database-third-normal-form-explained-in-simple-english/">
    3rd normal form</a> (3NF) database. Although this would mean more tables and more glue
    to stick everything together for queries, it would also mean a more maintainable
    model because data is organized better. 3Nf means better space utilization because in
    a single table model you would have to null out a bunch of fields you are using.
    In a multi-table model you only use what you need and if you have to null a bunch
    of fields it would only be contained in that one sub-table. Although not a
    requirement from the appeals unit at my work, it was definitely on my todo list
    way back when I first picked up this project.
</p>
<p>
    I am still playing around with GORM but creating that structure in Go and having it
    map directly to database tables was a great first step for me.
</p>

<h4>Group Project</h4>
<p>
    For both classes, we had a mandatory online meeting via slack and google docs to flesh
    out the software requirements for this course. I think we did a good job working together
    as a team. Everyone showed up on Tuesday in the Slack channel to give feedback to what
    they imagined the requirements should look like. My contributions include:
    <ul>
        <li>Cover page, without names</li>
        <li>Stakeholder matrix layout with suggestions for the first stakeholder</li>
        <li>Stakeholder footer with an explanation of impact and influence</li>
        <li>Listing out every functional with "The system shall..." (Got that one from a IEEE software standards document)</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    I feel like the actual functional requirements was lacking something. I mentioned it 
    to the group, but I really didn't have a good answer to why it felt off. I was imagining
    that each requirement would be broken down into actors and other useful information
    a group of stakeholder would find useful if they needed to reference this document again.
</p>
<p>
    Anyways I am happy with the turnout from the group and it all really felt like it was a group
    effort.
</p>

<h4>AWS Update</h4>
<p>
    Quick update with the project. I am moving some of the Archive server data to the newly 
    encrypted hard drive because I have had a lot of failures with a specific bay on the 
    SAS array. If another HDD was to fail I would have data loss that is not backed up anywhere.
    It is critical to get that data off as soon as I can.
</p>
<p>
    I have reached out to a contact at the enterprise offices of technology services and security
    or EOTSS for short (formally MassIT and A.K.A. ITD for Massachusetts) and they generated the
    security change control need to provision the AWS instance in our border. We are really making
    progress.
</p>

<br>
<h4>Data Structures</h4>
<p>
    Little side note: I asked the professor teaching the course if it was fine if I coded
    the labs in Golang since that is what I am most comfortable using. Java is the bane of
    my existence and really detest working for it. She was fine with submitting the labs in that
    language. I even suggested I will document the code and even provide the compiled executable
    with a SHA-256 hash and Virus Total scan link showing the Unix executable was clean. The only
    thing is the exam has some coding programs in Java, so I cannot entire escape it.
</p>
<p>
    I had to re-write a lot of the lab in Go and that has taken me longer than what I was expecting
    but I accomplish it. I think re-writing the labs in more critical fashion is helping me grasp
    the real concepts of the class. Everyone else just has to complete a few methods expanding an
    already provided data structure class. I, on the other hand, am really breaking the data structure 
    concepts down and translating that to a completely different language.
</p>
<p>
    I am pretty excited for this class now.
</p>

<h4>Other PluralSight Course</h4>
<p>
    I started to take another PluralSight course after I identified an area I feel is lacking
    in my professional development toolkit, communication. Luckily, they have a path for technical
    communication and thought that was a great place to start. The course I am running through now
    is <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/crisis-communication-technology-colleagues">Crisis Communication and Technology: Communicating with Colleagues</a> 
    and I have already picked up on some effective crisis communication strategies. The quote from
    above is a quote I liked from the beginning of the course. I think I will try to complete this path.
</p>

<h4>Next Week</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Finish appeal import job using GORM</li>
    <li>Attach newly mapped appeal tables to existing webserver</li>
    <li>Get AWS instance CMS approved</li>
</ul>
