<h3>What I am doing this week</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Continuing to complete my Appeals database App at work (This will be
        ongoing until completion)</li>
    <li>Software Engineering</li>
    <li>Other Classes</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Appeals Database</h4>
<p>
    Actually took a break from the database this week because I had a lot of other
    priorities at work I needed to take care of first.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Software Engineering</h4>
<p>
    We actually got a lot done last week and I took a break from software engineering
    to help out my wife with our newborn child. I also worked on my online course
    report about GORM which I have mentioned a lot in my blogs. I rewatched some of
    the sections with 2 times playback. Other than that I really focused on my other
    classes and home life.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Other Classes</h4>
<p>
    After some painstakingly long hours troubleshooting what was going wrong with
    my PXE environment, I manage to successfully get a virtual machine to boot over
    the network. It was part CentOS7 changing a lot from CentOS6 and the fact that
    the lab I was working with was made in 2013 so a lot has changed in 5 years.
    After that, I started working on another lab about LDAP. I think I found a bug
    in the 389-console that prevents the administrator from excepting the SSL
    certification. I had to re-install 389-ds and start all over again without
    securing the communications with the admin portal.

<p>
    In Data Structures, I had to work with previous knowledge of doubly-linked lists
    and add an iterator function for the users to use to further control their data
    that isn't possible from the base set of functions. My iterator allows them to
    traverse back and forth and let them control their output I couldn't even imagine.
    For example, the teacher wrote a text file that had a secret message if you played
    it in reverse and skipped every other letter. I was able to successfully do it
    with an array linked-list, but because I was lazy and added everything to the beginning
    of a list the message prints out incorrectly. I need to revisit and see if I can 
    add everything to the end.
