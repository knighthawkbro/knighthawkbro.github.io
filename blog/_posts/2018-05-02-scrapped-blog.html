<h3>Java, Back at it Again</h3>
<p>
    I will be starting my new position soon. The guys at Moviri made it pretty
    clear that I would be using either Java or Python from time to time. I have
    decided to brush up on my skills with java using Pluralsight. I am starting
    with basics using the course 'Java Fundamentals: The Java Language' by Jim
    Wilson. It is targeted at beginners, but I feel like I need a good overview
    of the language again since I forget most of it.
</p>
<p>
    It has been a while since I tackled Java. Last time was in the course 
    'Object Oriented Progamming' back in 2015 after I had just finished CS I 
    &amp; II using C++. The concept of OOP is not new to me and I have a pretty
    good idea what to expect from the language.
</p>
<p>
    The reason I tend to stay clear of Java is I feel it is a bloated language.
    I don't like the fact it has both abstract classes and interfaces. I get
    why that is the case, but all you end up doing is preferring one over the
    other in practice. I detest getters and setters when creating classes
    because it should seem apparent what I want to get and set using the code
    in the main function. By the time I spend designing and creating my classes
    I have already written like 300+ lines of code. Unfortunately, it doesn't
    matter a whole lot what I think because most of the corporate world uses
    Java for its applications. 
</p>
<p>
    I come from a C and Golang background and love procedural programming a
    lot. I enjoy using structs and methods and I tend to avoid the OOP world
    purposefully. I believe code should be easy to read and easier to maintain.
    If I can get one thing done in less than 100 lines of code, why should I
    even bother with 200+ lines of bloatware. I think that is why Python is so
    popular, because the give you the options to use OOP without forcing it
    down your throat. I just prefer a minimalist approach that compiles to a
    nice binary.

    I have gotten a bit off track ranting about Java.
