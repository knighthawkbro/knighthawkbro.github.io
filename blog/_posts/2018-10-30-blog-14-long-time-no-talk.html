<h4>Moviri, Inc.</h4>
<p>
    Little update since I have gone dark for a considerable 
    amount of time. Starting work at Moviri was like diving 
    straight into the deep end. The Moviri team has a 
    startup culture which means that everything is hand on 
    decks. We have a group of less than 10 taking on many 
    projects at once. So far, I have seen to completion 
    three very different projects. Over the course the past 
    few months I have learned a lot. 
</p>
<p>
    I have spent a considerable amount of time learning how 
    data is consumed within the TSCO Application and learned 
    a lot of Java fixing bugs in the ETL code. Right now, I 
    feel like I finally have a grip on the general flow of 
    the day to day work that I can finally sit down and 
    write a blog again. I still have a lot more to learn. 
    Documentation and presenting is still on my weak side. 
    I need to look out for some of the small details I tend 
    to gloss over since I am moving so fast. I cannot rely 
    on the software to carry me, the customers have already 
    bought the software from BMC, they come to us for our 
    expertise and what “We” bring to the table.
<p>
    Hopefully, I can start up this blog in a regular 
    interval to document the cool things I am learning.

<h4>Resteasy JAX-RS 2.0+ Client with Basic Auth & Accepting All SSL Certificates</h4>
<p>
    The real reason for this blog post is to go over some 
    code I wrote to initialize a Resteasy client. There is 
    tons of posts and documentation on the subject, but I 
    was unable to find anything specific to my particular 
    issue.
</p>
<p>
    <b><u>My Problem:</u></b> ETL code was written a couple 
    years ago. Most of the client initialization code used 
    is now deprecated. ETL was moved to a newer system and 
    code is failing with the latest libraries.
</p>
<p>
    <b><u>My Approach:</u></b> Understand the goals of the 
    initClient() function. Figure out what part of the code 
    works and what I need to gut. Most important, keep this 
    code more simple then when I started.
</p>
<p>
    <b><u>My Solution:</u></b> After googling the initial 
    errors and really having a hard time understanding the 
    state of the code. I started the statements in reverse 
    and worked my way back. Basically, the client’s using 
    a monitoring solution that has a queriable API I can 
    create a connection to. As the name of the function 
    implies, it initializes this interface for a Resteasy 
    client. The interface is annotated and design to run 
    some functions against different URIs and get specific 
    parameters using this reverse proxy client. This is a 
    very object-oriented approach. Besides just feeding a 
    regular client to this proxy object client there are a 
    few conditions to take care of.
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        HTTPS is used to secure communications between the 
        application server and the monitoring tool. I will 
        need to use a secure protocol and have a strategy 
        to accept the signed certificate.
    </li>
    <li>
        Basic Authentication headers are used with a username 
        and password.
    </li>
    <li>
        Make sure that the client uses the Resteasy interface 
        to query different parts of the monitoring solution 
        in an object-oriented way.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    I was able to find some information about the about the 
    proxy framework straight from the 
    <a href="http://docs.jboss.org/resteasy/docs/3.6.1.Final/userguide/html/RESTEasy_Client_Framework.html#proxies">JBoss documentation</a> 
    for Resteasy which looks exactly like the way the rest 
    of the ETL works. The foundation is set, I need to 
    establish a client, point it to a target, and feed it 
    through this proxy. To feed the interface to the target, 
    you would run this:
    <br>
<pre>
<code>
Client = Target.proxy(interface.class);
</code>
</pre>
</p>
<p>
    Basic Authentication can be accomplished relatively easy 
    using the ResteasyWebTarget object and registering a 
    BasicAuthentication object which is actually apart of the
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/35418136" target="_blank">Resteasy library</a>
    . This takes care of securely 
    hashing the username and password in the header to send 
    it over for authentication. This can be done easily with 
    this line here:
    <br>
<pre>
<code>
Target.register(new BasicAuthentication(username, password));
</code>
</pre>
</p>
<p>
    Testing the client so far reveals one more issue. The 
    client doesn’t know how to accept the certificate for 
    the API. I knew what I needed to do, but unfortunately, 
    I am so unfamiliar with the Resteasy library I have no 
    idea what to do. Finally, after a few hours of trial and 
    error, I skimmed over the existing code once more and 
    found a section that creates a TrustStrategy object that 
    was used previously to accept all certificates. This is 
    not the best solution to run on production servers since 
    if anyone can highjack that domain, I would securely 
    communicate with a malicious entity. I decided to keep 
    the trust all certificates because the monitoring 
    solution should not be exposed to the public and it was 
    used previously. Maybe at a later date, I would 
    implement the use of TrustStores that will store the 
    certificates for a more secure implementation, but I 
    digress. Since this little snippet worked before and was 
    not deprecated, I kept it. I quickly found online a
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/19519566" target="_blank">solution</a>
    that uses an SSL context builder I can load this 
    TrustStrategy object and attach it to the client when I 
    am building it. Here is the final code:
</p>
<pre>
<code>
private void initClient() throws KeyStoreException, KeyManagementException, NoSuchAlgorithmException {
    TrustStrategy acceptAll = new TrustStrategy() {
        public boolean isTrusted(java.security.cert.X509Certificate[] arg0, String arg1) throws java.security.cert.CertificateException {
            return true;
        }
    };
    SSLContextBuilder sslBuilder = new SSLContextBuilder();
    sslBuilder.loadTrustMaterial(acceptAll);
    Client c = ResteasyClientBuilder.newBuilder().sslContext(sslBuilder.build()).build();
    
    ResteasyWebTarget target = (ResteasyWebTarget) c.target(https:// + host + “:” + port);
    target.register(new BasicAuthentication(username, password);
    client = target.proxy(Interface.class);
}    
</code>
</pre>
<p>
    Can’t get much simpler than this. You have the 
    “acceptAll” TrustStrategy that is fed into an SSL 
    Context Builder which is fed into the client using the 
    Resteasy Client Builder object. From there I need to 
    point the client to a base target. I then add basic
    authentication headers to the target and feed that 
    object through a proxy I simply named interface for 
    clarity which follows the Resteasy proxy framework and 
    everything started working again as it did before 
    integrating the ETL with the new libraries. This code 
    now even works with the 10.7 version of the ETL too. The
    previous code used a ton of hacks and shortcuts that 
    didn’t really seem to make the code any easier to 
    understand or troubleshoot. I am confident that this 
    little snippet will help anyone else who has to maintain 
    this code and understand without scratching their heads 
    for two days as I did.
