<h3>Finally!</h3>
<p>
    After the long 8 years Bachelor's path from Bunker hill where I got my
    associates and transferred to Wentworth Institute of Technology, I can
    finally say I am done. The ceremony was interesting I had really no 
    idea what was going on. Apparently, I was the only one from my major
    graduating that day. 
</p>
<p>
    They told us to come at 12:30, but it seemed to drag on waiting for
    the commencement at 2 PM. I managed to fill myself up on chewy Nature's
    Valley bars and chips just before we had to go. We filed in right after
    the bagpipe marching band. Everything seemed to go smoothly after that.
</p>
<p>
    I graduated <i>cum laude</i> with a Bachelors in Computer Networking
    and a minor in computer science. Great job by Wentworth to power through
    300+ graduates in a relatively short period of time. My wife, Melania, 
    my wife's friends, my parents, and brother came to the ceremony. Seats
    were not a problem since there was a low amount of graduates at the
    graduation.

    They had two speakers before the diplomas. The first speaker was a master
    student graduating with special honors. She was mostly talking to the
    women of the audience and told them to stop caring because it was being
    a roadblock in their careers. The second speaker was more interesting.
    He moved to the US from Lebanon in the 80's and basically only knew 'hi'
    and 'bye'. He worked his way up and by accident landed himself a public
    sector job at Massport. He talked about some of his struggles as a Muslim
    immigrant after 9/11 and his successes at work. He was given an honorary
    degree from Wentworth.

    Afterwards, my family left for the afternoon, and my wife and I went home
    with her friends and had some Monte Cristo's to celebrate. I thought the
    Russians understood what fajitas were and they ordered two big meals for
    themselves. I just went with the tried and trusted burrito. They were so
    surprised at the amount of food and the three of them were unable to 
    finish. Rest of the night was spent with well-deserved relaxation.
