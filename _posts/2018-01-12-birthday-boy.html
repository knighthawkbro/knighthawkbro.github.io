</ul>
<h4>Appeals Database</h4>
<p>
    The appeals database has been a responsibility of mine ever since the DBA that
    created it dumped on my plate as he was getting more and more work. We were
    good friends at the time and I expressed my interest in databases. The appeals 
    database was originally crafted in Microsoft Access and over the years I have 
    learned a lot about access (probably more than I wanted to!).
