<h3>What I am doing this week</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Continuing to complete my Appeals database App at work (This will be ongoing until completion)</li>
    <li>Software Engineering Update</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Appeals Database</h4>
<p>
    I spent most of my time starting to explore deployment methods. I have spent a great time
    with Docker and wanted to containerize my appeals app so I can deploy anywhere that supports
    containers. This can be in your own datacenter with an instance of Kubernetes or Docker Swarm
    for orchestration. Or it can be in the cloud provider of your choosing, AWS/GAE/ACS. First I
    ran through a bunch of videos on Pluralsight getting me up to speed with using Docker in depth
    and Kubernetes. I learned that Docker for community has a edge edition that allows you to run
    an instance of kubernetes instead of swarm on your laptop for development. 
</p>
<p>
    Once the edge version was installed I quickly enabled the feature inside of the docker
    preferences to swap between the orchestration methods. I was off and running my kubernetes
    instance but realized that I couldn't get access to the dashboard like I could with Minikube.
    Instead I found the dashboard github page which had some kubernetes YAML files to start up
    a node running the dashboard. It is as easy as downloading the file or pointing to the raw
    GitHub dump of the text file and telling kubernetes to create. In minutes the daskboard is
    up and running and with no programming used at all. Now I can really see what is running
    in my environment.
</p>
<p>
    Utilizing a DockerFile to build my project I tell docker to take a linux instance with
    Go already installed. This was provided by the official Go docker image on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/library/golang/">Docker Hub</a>.
    I then copy all my source code to the containers $GOPATH\src directory and as a development
    feature I instruct the container to build the app and run it when it starts. I think once 
    I get the application production ready I will instead just copy over the templates and binary
    to the docker images that way the container doesn't have to build the app every single time
    it is started.
</p>
<p>
    Then I needed to make some config files for Kubernetes to understand. These are built a little
    different than a dockerfile. The dockerfile is more imperative which explains step-by-step how
    to build the container. In Kubernetes, we tell the engine what to do declaratively. Declaritive
    means that you tell Kubernetes what you expect and Kubernetes handles all the busy work. This
    busy work includes all the networking, scaling up an app across nodes, creating services, exposing
    ports, handling all the IP addressing and DNS between apps. In a YAML file that was less than 50
    lines.
</p>
<p>
    I also had to update my appeal importer program to import into the MSSQL database I launched into
    my Kubernetes instance. I made sure to expose a node port so I could access it from my laptop. Then
    all I had to do is point my config file to localhost and the exposed MSSQL port and it could start
    inserting rows right into the datbase. I ran into a bunch of issues where the appeals web server
    nodes were starting up before the MSSQL databse. I didn't want to host my docker images in the
    cloud, so in the kubernetes config I needed to tell it when I told which image to load to never
    fetch it from the cloud which forced it to look at my computer only. Later I think I would just
    push my images to a private repository in the cloud like AWS or Google Cloud and point Kubernetes
    there.
</p>

<h4>Software</h4>
<p>
   I checked with my group to see what was due for the week. Kind of confused with the deliveries, but
   I found out it is just a book report. Powered through <i>Don't Make Me Think</i> and finished it in
   3 days. Enjoyed it heavily and will try to get his other books and chew through them as well.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Next Week</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Finish up some notices and forms</li>
    <li>I think my group wants to finish the sub-features this week, so guess we will be coding</li>
</ul>
