<h3>What I am doing this week</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Continuing to complete my Appeals database App at work (This will be
        ongoing until completion)</li>
    <li>Finishing group features, and working on ERD and Inputs/Outputs </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h4>Appeals Database</h4>
<p>
    Now that I am taking two days off a week for my newborn, I have a little
    less time to devote to this project. But the amount of work I put into this
    app this week is far greater then some of the weeks before. First, I came
    back to work and turned off the daily task that goes and fetches the Appeals
    of the last day and uploads it to the Access database. I need to test my sftp
    functions out. So while I waited a day for the extract, I decided it would be
    A good time to do some R&amp;D.
</p>
<p>
    I was reading the book needed for network security and remembered all about
    two-factor authentication (2FA). With everything I started looking for a good 
    Go library that can do 2FA. I tried out a few but nothing seemed to work as
    well as <a href="https://github.com/sec51/twofactor">TwoFactor</a> from Sec51.
    This library seems perfect. It supports <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4226">RFC4226</a>
    for Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) One Time Passwords and 
    <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238">RFC6238</a> for Time-based One Time
    passwords. Even better it also supports up to 8 digits from the standard
    6 digit passcodes and SHA2 with 256-bit and 512-bit hashes. SHA1 is deprecated
    and google and some other researchers proved that a <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2017/02/announcing-first-sha1-collision.html">collision attack</a>
    has SHAttered SHA1.

    I finished out a working module that would generate a secret key for a user.
    Then it would generate the QR code png needed for the client to sign up a 
    soft token phone app to my module. I tested the ability to save an encrypted
    binary to a file which could easily be saved to a database BLOB or similar
    datatype. And finally the 8 character code was working on two different iPhone
    apps, Lastpass Authenticator and another app that was just named Authenticator.
    So, I have a working 2FA module I could easily implement in the Appeal's
    database.
</p>
<p>
    I also created a new branch in the git repo for the appeal's database for the
    GORM integration. I really wanted the ability if I couldn't get anything to work,
    I could just easily switch back to the master branch and either start over again
    or completely scrap the GORM idea. I wiped the other database that had the old 
    test data loaded in. I have the old SQL statements that could rebuild that information
    if needed. Then I ran my appeals import job with some minor tweaks. I needed to add the
    Sessions database and some new columns in the appeal table and I am ready to go.
</p>
<p>
    I tackled the sessions first because that is the first database interaction the
    users will have. I needed to log all the session created against the database and
    who logged in and at what time. I implemented the soft delete with the sessions
    that way I could keep a log and still keep the same logic for checking old sessions
    and delete expired sessions. I ran into a little snag with checking if sessions
    were over 3600 seconds, but I was able to work around that snag. Once I was able
    to successfully log in, I felt more confident that the full migration over to
    GORM was going to work.
</p>
<p>
    Then I worked on the other sections and made sure the view layer was using the new
    and improved structures. Now that I am completely finished migrating the web server
    over to the new database I can finally finish up some of the long waited features
    like forms and notices. Using GORM really streamlines the whole process of writing
    SQL code for database interactions. 
</p>

<h4>Finishing up Group Features</h4>
<p>
    We had an interesting group meet on thursday. We decided that we were not going
    to do any mobile apps because there was only one of us who had any experience
    writing mobile apps. We knew what we could do, just no one was prepared to tackle
    learning a whole new language or interacting with Xamarin. So we decided the
    next best bet was to do something we all know, a website.
</p>
<p>
    We had initially decided that there was going to be 4 groups, a database team, an
    UI-client team, an UI-admin team, and a Admin miscellaneous group that could handle
    anything else. We quickly realized that the UI-admin will be doing all the work
    while the other groups basically twiddled their thumbs. I thought it would be a good
    idea to break the groups up further as we just decided that we are going to do
    a full web app. Now each UI team would have a frontend and a backend. That way
    people could focus on the look and feel while others could work on the behind the
    scenes work. I was initially thinking that there would be two front ends and one
    backend but we ended up voting for two backends and two frontends. We also redistributed
    the teams again. I think this breakup of teams will work because it allows us to really
    focus on the features.
</p>
<p>
    Now, that I am on the database team, I really think I will push Tim in the right
    direction. He seems to think that he has everything figured out, and I am here
    to double check his work. He assumed that everything was going to live in one 
    table at first, but after some serious discussions the amount of tables when to
    3 then 4 now it is up to 5 and is really looking like a legitimate database
    structure. I started working on the inputs and outputs for the website. Basically,
    there will be an admin and a client. The client will be able to input into certain
    tables, but cannot see anything afterwards. The admin will have the feature to set up
    client logins, sessions, rooms. and see the form data that is inserted into the database.
    Anyways I think we are ahead of our project and we will get back to it next week.
