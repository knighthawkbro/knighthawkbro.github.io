<h3>What I am doing this week</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Continuing to complete my Appeals database App at work (This will be ongoing until completion)</li>
    <li>Software Engineering Update</li>
    <li>Career Fair</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Appeals Database</h3>
<p>
    I didn't specifically work on anything regarding the website this week. It has been all hands on deck
    trying to get to get AWS up and running for next week. We are able to connect these AWS Workspaces up
    to our virtual private cloud (VPC) and get access to a windows 10 box with SQL Management Studio. This
    will streamline the process of getting people connected and workspaces even support accessing the instance
    via a web browser, Chromebook, IOS, and Andriod. I managed to get everything up and running in a few days
    and now it is up to the database team to get me a backup I can work with so I can load the SQL instance
    with some data.

<h3>Software Engineering</h3>
<p>
    Group had already completed all the labs until number 10. I think we will be helping other folks complete
    their deliverables and try to get this project done in the next couple weeks. Quiet week for software
    engineering.

<h3>Career Fair</h3>
<p>
    I dressed up in my wedding suit complete with bow tie and set off. Printed out 20 or so resumes and
    headed up to school. The fair was split up to the auditorium in Watson Hall and the gymnasium. I started
    with the auditorium first. I first took care of my LinkedIn photo because I figured the longer I waited
    the less good I would look. The first couple booths were awkward but I got the hang of it once I transitioned
    to the gym. It wasn't until halfway through the fair I noticed that the colors under the company logos 
    matched our name tags. Each major had their own color and you can just quickly look to figure out what
    each employer was looking for.

    I stopped by the FBI booth and noticed that they were packed with students. I started to stand with a
    group but got quickly bored because all the person was talking about was drugs and what would immediately
    disqualify you from the FBI. Starry seamed like a cool place to work, they were interested in any
    experience in Golang. I only got to talk to the guy who handles the networking side of things. I talked to
    some folks from Moviri and they were super psyched to talk to me. I will probably have an interview sometime
    next week. One of the companies I didn't do any research on impressed me the most.

<p>
    Fast Enterprises is doing work with local government agencies around the country offering their technical
    expertise and tax product. Currently, they were working with the RMV to update their systems. They are 
    working with the department of revenue to migrate them to their tax system. They are currently looking
    for a technical team member that would be able to work with the clients directly building out solutions
    for them. The most attractive opportunity is the relocation services provided. I wouldn't be guaranteed
    a spot in Boston, but I can submit to HR 3 places in the US I would want to live in, and 3 places I
    would not. I told my wife right after I went home and she was more than onboard to relocate somewhere
    warmer. I had a formal interview with the company Friday. I think it went well. I only had 30 minutes
    to take the informal test and I went with a rather unoptimized IsPrime() function. I was testing every
    number every number less than the parameter starting at 1 and continuing upwards until either the current
    iteration is a multiple or I ran out of numbers. This method doesn't scale well with large numbers and I
    was grilled on it. I answered all their questions and besides the inefficient method, I feel I did well.
    I hope they answer back because this company looks seriously promising.
