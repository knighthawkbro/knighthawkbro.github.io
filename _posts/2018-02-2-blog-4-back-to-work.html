        leave your login info on a Post-it note on your desk, while the people
        that you f***ing ripped off are physically in your office, it's not a
        hack. It's barely social engineering. It's more like natural selection.

<h4>Appeals Database</h4>
<p>
    Finally, back at the office after a short hiatus. I think letting a week sink in after starting
    the GORM project gave me the time to really digest what I learned. Kind of like when you write
    a paper and let a few days pass so you can have fresh eyes to look over your work. I really
    like I am grasping the concept of Object Relational Mapping. I basically finished up the extract, 
    transform, load (ETL) work yesterday.
</p>
<p>
    I basically exported the appeals MS Access database into a text file, separated by tabs. Then 
    took the struct tables I created earlier before the baby and mapped each column to their
    respective attribute in the struct. Even the polymorphic address table is working perfectly.
    I have never even thought that polymorphism is possible in relational databases. Basically,
    I have two types of addresses to store for each appeal, the appellant and their optional
    representative. It uses a combination of two additional fields that I named resident ID and Type.
    GORM takes care of the rest when I explicitly tell it that the Person's Address has a polymorphic
    relationship with an address. The type lets me know if it is a representative or an appellant
    and the ID that is stored is actually the ID of the person it is storing information about.
    Super cool.
</p>
<p>
    I reduced the number of columns I would need to have in the person and representative table 
    by forcing them to store their information in the same table called addresses. GORM takes care of the
    joining for me and as the web designer I am glad I do not have to think about complex SQL
    statements in order to glue all this information together. I defined it once in the structs
    and GORM takes care of the complexity. This is exactly what I was trying to solve when I began
    adding some of the 80+ attributes to an appeal struct in December. I really need this code
    to look and feel maintainable. 
</p>
<p>
    The other thing that I accomplished with GORM is once the data was in a slice of appeals cases
    I was able to iterate each item in the slice and save it to the Linux MSSQL database I have
    been running as a development database. I even had benchmark tests run like when I run the 
    seeddb function I create a begin time saved as a Unix timestamp and when the loading finishes
    I calculate how long in minutes and seconds it took the function to run. Turns out to load
    3,200 appeals and over 6,000 outreach notes it took one minute and fifty-one seconds.
</p>
<p>
    The only minor issue I have with GORM is really not an issue at all. It is the lazy-loading
    it does when I pull records from the database. It is really meant as a performance boost
    because really, when are you really going to need all 80+ columns loaded into a single
    data structure? I kind of wish there was an eager-loading flag I could turn on if I did
    indeed need all that data injected to the appeal object. Because the only way to do that
    is to call a function call <code>Preload("table_name")</code> and chain it on to the db object
    you are currently using. It forces the programmer to have to know all the relationships
    in order to get some meaningful data. You can't just say use this appeal object, but only 
    return the slice of hearing dates for a particular appeal without having to know that those
    hearing dates are tied to some action which in turn is tied to some appeal case.

<h4>Features &amp; <i>Why Software Sucks</i></h4>
<p>
    Even though the Doc was sick this week, we still managed to come together as a group online
    and start fleshing out some of the features needed to fulfill some requirements. I was 
    stuck on the security requirement my group put down as a functional requirement. It didn't
    make a whole lot of sense because it was so vague. I remember spending an extraodinary amount
    of time in the session arguing (in a civil manor) why all the other's suggestions suck.
    This is the same day I finished chapter 3 of the book <i>Why Software Sucks</i> which completely
    deals with security in applications.
</p>
<p>
    My thought process is that the Doc mentioned briefly that he didn't want to over complicate
    anything with a logon process with a username and password. I suggested that in order to make
    sure that the volunteer responsible is the one input data we would have the volunteer also
    input some information about them self on top of the numbers they were submitting. This could
    be as simple as a last name or initials or first initial + last name or email address. Something
    they would remember in a heartbeat because it belongs to them in some form or fashion. What I got
    in response sounded exactly like the programmers David Platt was berating in his book. I got
    responses like my suggestion is not unique enough. The volunteers need something along the lines
    of WIT emails last name + first initial + some number (i.e. walshb8, hayesj2, coxt1 ...). My
    response was just it wasn't user friendly enough and way too complicated for no added reason.
    Like the code camp would have 8 sessions in total for the day, and worse case that would
    mean 8 different volunteers counting attendance. The odds of two volunteers having the same
    last name or even the same first initial would be very slim.
</p>
<p>
    One other student suggested something that made me laugh and my wife thought I was crazy.
    They said that we should create a unique IDs that cannot be easily guessed. I posed the
    question, "Do you want to be the one who supports all the volunteers who forgot the id?" Then
    I laughed to myself when he suggested that we would either give each volunteer a piece of 
    paper with their ID on it or just email them. My response was that if we are giving the 
    volunteers paper we might as well get them a pen so they can write the attendance down
    and just submit it at the end physically. It would take zero code to implement and achieve
    the same goal as spending an entire course developing an app that paper and pen could 
    achieve faster and more securely.
</p>
<p>
    The person got defensive and his counter was this is easy stuff to do. I thought I am
    actually dealing with a one of those pesky programmers David talked about that thinks
    his way is perfect because it solves all the cases in his head perfectly. Anyways,
    the email thing brought up a good point. Email addresses are inherently unique and
    I would suppose that most people who have any social media account know their email
    like the back of their hand. The organizers would have a list of people who will be
    volunteering and most likely the main form of communication will be email so why not
    make all the volunteers submit their email before they submit their numbers and that
    way everything is guaranteed to be unique and somewhat prevents anyone from submitting
    garbage numbers.
</p>
<p>
    Nope, that is a security hazard apparently. When I tried to challenge why that is the case
    I didn't get an explanation back which goes to show you that this particular team member
    was really disconnected from his users. Maybe he was afraid that having things tied to
    email exposes it somehow to everyone? I don't know how it would unless you programmed the 
    system to do that by default which is a silly idea in the first place. The more and more
    I puzzle myself over this single requirement dilemma, the more it just makes me want to
    create a Google Form that points to a single Google sheet document and collects all this
    information for us. Again, zero effort from a programming perspective and it would accomplish
    the goals for this project easily. Easiest 20 minutes of my life.
</p>
<p>
    I wanted to briefly explain the quote a bit more. I remember going over the social engineering
    section of the text and when he got to user writing passwords down on a sticky note I just 
    had to include this brilliant quote from one of my all-time favorite television shows. They 
    even had an episode where they had user test and give feedback on the application. The main
    character ended up making a great app with the UI/UX in mind of a programmer and had zero
    design choices to make the interface simpler to understand. They even through in a clippy
    joke in the episode the reminds me of David's anger for the late Microsoft mascot.
